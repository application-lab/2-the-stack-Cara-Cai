        <h1>Introduction: What is Bilibili?</h1>
        <p> Bilibili is a famous video app in China, where everyone can make his own video and upload it. Thus its resources are rather rich.
            It features that people can have their comments shown on the screen, which is called “barrage” in China.
            Also, it automatically shows relevant videos that users have recently watched, which are tailored to their intersts,
            so that it has become one of the most popular video apps among young people in China.

        <p>The users of Bilibili has been growing every year due to the spread of internet and increasing popularity of Bilibili, who are mainly young people.
            However, the addiction often occurs because that the filtered contents are so attractive. Since most of the videos are short, so that users keep 
            watching without noticing the time. Me myself was a case in point though.</p>

           <p>The picture shows the installation interface of Bilibili on my phone. As you can see, I uninstalled it becasue I found that it had taken too much of my time. 
            So I just deleted it before I wanted to open it again! </p>

       <p>Bilibili servers, maybe algoritm itself, are doing the job which is to attract more users for longer time.
        They mostly choose the relevent videos which make users addicted but not the really needed ones. And users don't 
        even realize that they are led in some way by the app.

        <p>  Bilibili has walked onto the stage of world.While people are sharing the rich resources and having fun together,
            they are facing the problem of being hooked on apps as well. The earth is always a whole thing.Users worldwide, as well as 
            the app servers should work together to build a healtier and ethical web environment.
